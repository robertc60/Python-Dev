Repo to hold code projects from Python Developer course on Linkedin Learning

**_Course: Learning Python_**

**_Lesson 1: Building Hello World_**

Created hello world application calling the main function using 

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
        
        
**_Lesson 2: Variable and Expressions_**

created variables, learned about scope and re-assignment, 
also learnt about the del function which clear a previously 
declared variable

**_Lesson 3: Python Functions_**

Learned how to build basic functions taking variable amounts of arguments

**_Lesson 4: Conditional Statements_**

learned how to build conditional statement with if, elif and else
also learnt to build compound conditional statements of the form

    st = "This will print if x is greater than y" if(x > y) else ("this will print if y is greater than x)

**_Lesson 5: Loops_**

learned how to build loops in python using while and for. 
also learned how to get the the loop index using enumerate

     days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
     for i,d in enumerate(days):
        print(i, d)
        
this would print the day of the week and the loop index. 
the day of the week would be held in d and the loop index 
in the variable i

**_Test to see if i can sign commit_**

**_Second test to see if commit is signed_**
